Your Face

“your face” is floating outside the fieldset.  It should be the legend.

The first fieldset has the wrong legend.  This fieldset is for the picture, so “Your Name” doesn’t work here.  Additionally the text before the input is missing.

“Image preview:” is missing from this section


Your General Details
“Date of birth” input should have a date type.  It has a time type instead
Part 1

Text before country selector should be “Which country”.


Your Indicators
Text before each slider is missing.


Your Contact Information
Text before check boxes is in the wrong order and not what was specified (In-app chat missing)

The submit button should be outside the fieldsets.


Suggestions
Avoid id/class names with spaces as it could be parsed oddly as two different entries.

More attention to detail with respect to the text requested.

Inputs are null fields.  They don’t have closing tags.



Part 2

The labels of the checkbox and the radio needs to have width:auto.  You used a class but applied it to the label of the checkbox.

For the words on both sides of the two range, you can use any appropriate style e.g. text-align:center.  Not sure what the class was supposed to do here.

Part 3

Looks good.  The picture isn’t shown on the page because you are missing the <img id=“preview” />
